  "content": "Subtest instructions: <br/>\nShow the child the sheet of letters in the student stimuli booklet.\n<br/>\nSay: <b>Here is a page full of letters of the alphabet. Please tell me the NAMES of as many letters as you can--not the SOUNDS of the letters, but the names. For example, the name of this letter</b> [point to A] <b> is “A”\n<br/>Let’s practise:  tell me the name of this letter</b> [point to V]: \n<li>If the child responds correctly say: <b>Very good, the letter name is VEE.</b>\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: <b>The name of this letter is “VEE.”\n<br/>\nNow try another one: tell me the name of this letter</b> [point to L]: \n<li> If the child responds correctly say: <b>Good, the name of this letter is “ELL.”</b>\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: <b>TThe name of this letter is “ELL.”</li> \n<br/>\nDo you understand what you are to do? \n<br/>\nWhen I say “Begin,” please name the letters as quickly and carefully as you can. Start here and continue this way.</b>  [Point to the first letter on the row after the example and draw your finger across the first line]. <b>If you come to a letter you do not know, I will tell it to you. Otherwise I will keep quiet and listen to you. Ready? Begin.</b>\n\n<br/><br/>\nReminders:<li>Start the timer when the child reads the first letter. <li>Touch each incorrect letter (it will become blue). Touch again to mark it correct if the child self-corrects.<li>Stay quiet, except when providing answers as follows: if the child hesitates for 3 seconds, provide the name of the letter, point to the next letter and say <b>“Please go on.”</b>Mark the letter you provide to the child as incorrect.<li>If the student gives you the letter sound, rather than the name, provide the letter name and say: <b>“Please tell me the NAME of the letter”</b>. This prompt may be given only once during the exercise.</li>\n<br/>\nAFTER 60 SECONDS (the screen will flash red) SAY, <b>“STOP.”</b> and touch the [Stop] button. Touch the final letter read (it will place a yellow box on the letter--ensure that this letter is correctly marked as either correct or incorrect.<br/>\nEarly stop rule: If the child does not give a single correct response on the first line, say <b>“Thank you!”</b>, Press the [Stop] button and the last letter attempted and go on to the next exercise.",
