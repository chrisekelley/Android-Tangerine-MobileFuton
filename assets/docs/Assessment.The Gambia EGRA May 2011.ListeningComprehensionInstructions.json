Then allow 15 seconds for each question. <br/>Say: <b>I am going to read you a short story aloud ONCE and then ask you some questions. Please listen carefully and answer the questions as best as you can. Do you understand what you are to do? </b>\n\n<br/>\nIf the child says \"yes\", read the following: \n<b>Pat lives on a farm with his family. Every year, the land gets dry. One afternoon, Pat saw dark clouds. Something hit his head lightly. The rains had come at last. </b>\n\n<br/>Reminders:<br/><li>Ask each question only once. <li>Touch the button that corresponds to the child's answer: [Correct], if they provide the correct answer; [Incorrect] If they provide a wrong answer or if they say they don't know the answer; [No answer] if the child remains silent for more than 15 seconds.</li>\n",
