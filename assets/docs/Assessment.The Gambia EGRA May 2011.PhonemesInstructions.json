Read aloud each word and have the student: repeat the word, identify the number of sounds, and say the sounds in each word. <br/>Say <b>\"This is a listening exercise. You know that each letter has a sound. So, pot, “p”_ “o” _ “t” can be pronounced p /p/, o /o/ and t /t/. \n<br/>\nLet’s try a letter first: tell me the sound of the letter “k”.</b>\n<li>If the child responds correctly /k/ say: <b>Very good, the sound in “k” is /k/.</b>\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: <b>The sound of the letter “k” is /k/. Now your turn, tell me the sound in the letter “k”.</b>\n<br/>\nNow tell me the sound of the letter “m”.\n<li> If the child responds correctly /m/ say: <b>Very good, the sound in “m” is /m/.</b>\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: <b>The sound of the letter “m” is /m/. Your turn, tell me the sound in “m”.</li> \n<br/>\nNow I am going to say a word. After I say it, repeat the word back to me and tell me the number of sounds in the word. Then make those sounds. If I say “key” you would say “key”, two sounds: /k/ and /e/.
