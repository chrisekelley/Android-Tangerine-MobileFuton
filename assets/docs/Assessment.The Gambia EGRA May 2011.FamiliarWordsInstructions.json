  "content": "Subtest instructions: <br/>\nShow the child the sheet of familiar words in the student stimuli booklet. Say:\n<br/>\n<b>Here are some words. I would like you to read to me as many words as you can </b> (do not spell the words, but read them). <b>For example, this word is: “cat” </b> [point to \"cat\"].<b><br/>\n\nLet’s practise:  please read this word</b> [point to the word “sick”]: \n\n<li> If the child responds correctly say: <b>Good, this word is “sick.”</b>\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: <b>This word is “sick.”</li> \n<br/>\n\nNow try another one:  please read this word </b> [point to the word “made”]: \n\n<li> If the child responds correctly say: <b>Good, this word is “made.”</b>\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: <b>This word is “made.”</li> \n<br/>\nWhen I say “begin,” read the words as quickly and carefully as you can. Read the words across the page, starting at the first row below the line. I will keep quiet and listen to you, unless you need help. Do you understand what you are to do? Ready? Begin.</b>\n<br/><br/>\nReminders:<li>Start the timer when the child reads the first word. <li>Follow along and touch any words read INCORRECTLY (they will turn blue). Touch the word again to count self-corrections as correct (it will no longer be blue). <li>Stay quiet, except when providing answers as follows: if the child hesitates for 3 seconds, provide the word, point to the next word and say <b>“Please go on.”</b> Mark the word you provide to the child as incorrect. \n<br/>\nAFTER 60 SECONDS,  SAY  <b>“STOP.”</b> Touch the [Stop] button, then touch the   last word read (be sure it is still appropriately marked either correct or incorrect). <br/> \nEarly stop rule: If you have marked as incorrect all of the answers on the first line, say <b>“Thank you!”</b>, touch the [Stop] button, mark the last letter attempted ensuring that it is still marked incorrect, and go on to the next exercise.\n",
