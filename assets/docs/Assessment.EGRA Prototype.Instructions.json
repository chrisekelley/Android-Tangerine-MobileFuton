  "content": "Subtest instructions: <br/>\nThis is NOT a timed exercise and THERE IS NO STUDENT SHEET. Read aloud each word and have the student: repeat the word, identify the number of sounds, and say the sounds in each word. <br/>Say \"This is a listening exercise. You know that each letter has a sound. So, pot, “p”_ “o” _ “t” can be pronounced p /p/, o /o/ and t /t/. \n<br/>\nLet’s try a letter first: tell me the sound of the letter “k”.\n<li>If the child responds correctly /k/ say: Very good, the sound in “k” is /k/.\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: The sound of the letter “k” is /k/. Now your turn, tell me the sound in the letter “k”.\n<br/>\nNow tell me the sound of the letter \"m”.\n<li> If the child responds correctly /m/ say: Very good, the sound in “m” is /m/.\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: The sound of the letter “m” is /m/. Your turn, tell me the sound in “m”.</li> \n<br/>\nNow I am going to say a word. After I say it, repeat the word back to me and tell me the number of sounds in the word. Then make those sounds. If I say “key” you would say “key”, two sounds: /k/ and /e/. Let’s try one. \n<br/>\nTell me the number of sounds in “hat” and what they are.\n<li>If the child responds correctly, say: Very good, there are 3 sounds in hat and the sounds are /h/ /a/ /t/.\n<li>If the child does not respond correctly, say: There are 3 sounds in hat: /h/ /a/ /t/. Your turn, tell me the sounds in hat.</li>\n<br/>\nDo you understand what you are to do?\n<br/><br/>\nReminders:In case the student says no, repeat both examples and explain in the home language. If the child does not respond after 10 seconds, provide the number and sounds of the word, mark it incorrect and move on. Score both the number of sounds (correct/incorrect) and correct sounding out of the word. Pronounce each word 2 times.\n<br/>",
