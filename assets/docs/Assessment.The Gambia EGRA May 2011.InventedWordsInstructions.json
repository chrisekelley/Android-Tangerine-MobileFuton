  "content": "Subtest instructions: <br/>\nShow the child the sheet of invented words in the student stimuli booklet. Say:\n<br/>\n<b>Here are some made-up words. I would like you to read as many as you can. Do not spell the words, but read them. For example, this made-up word is: “ut”.<b><br/>\n\nLet’s practise:  please read this word</b> [point to the word “dif”]: \n\n<li> If the child says \"dif\", say: <b>Very good, “dif.”</b>\n<li>If the child does say \"dif\" correctly, say: <b>This made-up word is “dif.”</li> \n<br/>\n\nNow try another one. Please read this word </b> [point to the word “mab”]: \n\n<li> If the child says \"mab\", say: <b>Good, this word is “mab.”</b>\n<li>If the child does not say \"mab\" correctly, say: <b>This word is “mab.”</li> \n<br/>\nWhen I say “begin,” read the words as quickly and carefully as you can. Read the words across the page, starting at the first row below the line. I will keep quiet and listen to you, unless you need help. Do you understand what you are to do? Ready? Begin.</b>\n<br/><br/>\nReminders:<li>Start the timer when the child reads the first word. <li>Follow along and touch any words read INCORRECTLY (they will turn blue). Touch the word again to count self-corrections as correct (it will no longer be blue). <li>Stay quiet, except when providing answers as follows: if the child hesitates for 3 seconds, provide the word, point to the next word and say <b>“Please go on.”</b> Mark the word you provide to the child as incorrect. \n<br/>\nAFTER 60 SECONDS, SAY  <b>“STOP.”</b> Touch the [Stop] button, then touch the last word attempted so that a yellow box appears on that word. (Be sure it is still appropriately marked either correct or incorrect). <br/> \nEarly stop rule: If you have marked as incorrect all of the words on the first line, say <b>“Thank you!”</b>, touch the [Stop] button, mark the last letter attempted ensuring that it is still marked incorrect, and go on to the next exercise.\n",
