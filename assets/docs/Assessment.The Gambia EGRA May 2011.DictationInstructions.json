  "content": "Subtest instructions: <br/>\n\nThis is NOT a timed exercise. Place a lined sheet of paper in front of the child. Say: <br/>I am going to read you a short sentence. Please listen carefully. I will read the whole sentence once. Then I will read it in parts so you can write what you hear. I will then read it again so that you can check your work. Do you understand what you are to do? </b>\n\n<br/>Read the following sentence aloud ONCE at about 1 word per second. \n<br/> \n<b>The boys decided to go and ride their bikes.</b>\n<br/>\nThen give the child a pencil, and repeat a SECOND time, grouping the words, with about 10 seconds after each group, allowing the child time to write:\n<br/> <b> “The boys decided” - “to go and” - “ride their bikes”.</b>\n\nThen repeat the sentence a THIRD time while the child is writing:<br/> \n<b>The boys decided to go and ride their bikes.</b>\n<br/>\n\nGive the child up to 15 seconds to complete writing after the third reading. \nTHIS EXERCISE WILL BE SCORED LATER.\n",
