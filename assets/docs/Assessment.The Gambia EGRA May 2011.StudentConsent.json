You were picked by chance, like in a raffle or lottery. We would like your help in this. But you do not have to take part if you do not want to.<li>We are going to play a reading game.  I am going to ask you to read letters, words and a short story out loud.<li>Using this computer, I will determine how long it takes you to read.</li><li>This is NOT a test and it will not affect your grade at school.</li><li>I will also ask you other questions about your family, like what language your family uses at home and some of the things your family has.</li><li>I will NOT write down your name so no one will know these are your answers.</li><li>Once again, you do not have to participate if you do not wish to.  Once we begin, if you would rather not answer a question, thatâ€™s all right.</li><li>Do you have any questions?
